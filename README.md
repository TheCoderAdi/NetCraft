## Introduction

The **NetCraft** is a dynamic tool designed to visualize and simulate various network topologies. Users can interactively explore different network structures, observe packet transfers, and analyze the performance of each topology.

## Usage

1. Select a network topology from the dropdown menu.
2. Specify sender and receiver nodes.
3. Click on "Transfer Packet" to start the simulation.
4. Observe the packet transfer animation and network statistics.

## Features

- **Supported Topologies**:

  - Mesh
  - Star
  - Ring
  - Bus
  - (Future: Tree, Hybrid, Fully Connected)
